TODO

-- NSIS 2 Beta 2 --

NSIS

* skip plugin calls, file instructions that add more than one file with +1 with goto

* move more ui changes to compile time.
  make progress bar flags be written directly in the UI (PBS_SMOOTH)
  inst details could be changed in compile time too

* component page for uninstaller, multiple sections

* more default texts in NLF language files

* current working directory changes

* different color for the drive space when there is not enough space

* all installer strings should be language strings

DOCUMENTATION

* user_vars should link to the user_vars section as in the old docs callbacks and
  other stuff should be linked too

* go over everything and search for mistakes :)

* links should have alternative text instead of Section 1.2.3.4

EXAMPLES

* write an advanced paging example showing multiple components page with multiple
  instfiles pages

* language files auto updater

INSTALLOPTIONS

* manual validation

* add an option for LBS_MULTIPLESEL too, not just LBS_EXTENDEDSEL
