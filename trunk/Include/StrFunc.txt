String Functions Header File Readme
-----------------------------------

String Functions Header File contains a set of good string manipulation
functions in a much simpler way to include and call in NSIS scripts.

How to use
----------

  Syntax

  Parameters are specified in this format: required (option1 | option2)
  [optional]

  The stars in command titles (*****) are the function usefulness in my
  opinion. 5 stars (*****) the function is much useful.

  Any time when is mentioned "Default is" means that you can use the value
  mentioned or keep blank, the result is the same.

  If you want a certain value (e.g. a text) to be language-specific, set a
  language string (using LangString) and define $(STRINGNAME) as value.

  If you want to add ` to a string, you should always escape it using $\`
  because the header file macro functions use ` to separate parameters.

  1. Include Header file
  ----------------------

    !include "StrFunc.nsh"

    StrFunc.nsh have to be in the Include directory, so you don't have to
    specify a path.

    You have to put this command before any command used in this header file.

  2. Commands
  -----------

    2.1 How To Use Commands In Install Sections and Functions
    ---------------------------------------------------------

    Every command used in install sections and functions have to be called
    first before and out any sections and functions, and without parameters.

    Example:
    --------

    !include "StrFunc.nsh"

    ${StrStr}

    Section

      ${StrStr} $0 "OK! Now what?" "wh"

    SectionEnd
    
    2.2 How To Use Commands In Uninstall Sections and Functions
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    Commands with Uninstall Sections and Functions support have "Un" before
    the words inside brackets "{}".

    Example:
    --------
    
    ${UnStrStr}
    
    Every command used in uninstall sections and functions have to be called
    first before and out any sections and functions, without parameters, and
    after the header command "${UnStrFunc}" to activate the Uninstall sections
    and functions support for the commands following.
    
    Example:
    --------

    !include "StrFunc.nsh"

    ${StrStr} # Supportable for Install Sections and Functions
    
    ${UnStrFunc} # Command to separate commands supportable for
                 # Install/Uninstall sections and functions

    ${UnStrStr} # Supportable for Uninstall Sections and Functions

    Section

      ${StrStr} $0 "OK! Now what?" "wh"

    SectionEnd
    
    Section Uninstall

      ${UnStrStr} $0 "OK! Now what?" "wh"

    SectionEnd

Comments
------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Token String Function

  New function not published in Archive, much better than original StrTok,
  going to replace several functions with just one. The principal idea was
  based on "Save On Variables" by Afrow UK.

Advanced String Sort Function

  New function not published in Archive, much better than original StrSort.

Another String Replace Function

  Another doesn't mean better and simpler than the original version.
  (Don't confuse the original StrRep that is in this header file with this
  one)

Convert / to // in Paths Function

  StrNSISToIO and StrIOToNSIS are better.

Copy from Clipboard Function

  Changed just the function name to the correct "CopyFromClipboard".


First String Part Function

  AdvStrTok (called here as StrTok) is better.


NSIS <-> Install Options String Convertor Functions

  Included from Install Options Readme.


Number to String Converter Function

  Have a serious bug when input is 5 chars long. Need to be remade to a
  simpler one.

Save on Variables Function

  AdvStrTok (called here as StrTok) is better.

Slash <-> Backslash Converter Function

  Will convert "http://www.site.com\" to "http:\\www.site.com/", not
  really useful for anyone.

Sort Strings (1, 2 and 3) Functions

  AdvStrTok (called here as StrTok), AdvStrStr (called here as StrStrAdv)
  and AdvStrSort (called here as StrSort) are better.

Split String Function

  AdvStrTok (called here as StrTok) is better.


StrTok Function

  AdvStrTok (called here as StrTok) is better.


Trim Function

  The real purpose of this function was to remove spaces from directory
  paths, and now with the NSIS command GetFullPathName this is not useful
  anymore.
