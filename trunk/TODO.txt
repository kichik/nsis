TODO

DOCUMENTATION

* user_vars should link to the user_vars section as in the old docs
  callbacks and other stuff should be linked too

* not so important but could be nice, links to examples in the examples directory for every function
  every function will link to the example file that containts it

* go over everything and search for mistakes :)

* Document InitPluginsDir and creating plugins (exdll.h)

EXAMPLES

* write an advanced paging example showing multiple components page with multiple instfiles pages

* write an example for each plugin

* go through each and every one of the examples and make sure they all compile and work as should

PLUGINS

* IO should have no defaults, it should only do what it is ordered to do, nothing more, nothing less
