* Moved to DLL, no longer need parentwnd ini writing

version 1.4 (11/18/2001)

* Added MULTISELECT flag. 
* Made the HWND list for the parent window controls dynamically allocated. This prevents a crash if NSIS ever gets more than 150 controls on it's main window.

* Fixed a problem where the window wouldn't draw properly on some systems (thanks felfert)

* Changed from InvalidateRect() to RedrawWindow() to force a redraw after a browse dialog
* On startup, set the flags of the NSIS window to include WS_CLIPCHILDREN. Otherwise, our controls don't get drawn right.
