\C{functions} Functions

Functions are like similar to Sections in that they contain zero or more instructions. Functions are not called by the installer directly, instead they are called from Sections using the Call instruction (Note: there are some special Callback Functions that can be called by the installer directly).

\b Functions must be declared outside of Sections or other Functions.

\b Function names beginning with "." (e.g. ".Whatever") are generally reserved for callback functions.

\b Function names beginning with "un." are functions that will be generated in the Uninstaller. Hence, normal install Sections and functions cannot call uninstall functions, and the Uninstall Section and uninstall functions cannot call normal functions.
